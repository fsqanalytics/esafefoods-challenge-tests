## AIM OF THE WORKSHOP

At the end of the workshop, the participant will have notions of:

1. the **modelling of microbiological challenge test data**, and the **importance of validation**;

2. how to **exploit microbial kinetic parameters** obtained from predictive microbiology models in the **validation of a process** and, ultimately, in the **assessment of exposure** to foodborne pathogens.


## AUDIENCE

The intended audience for this workshop includes **Master/PhD students**, **researchers** and **academic staff** who have an interest in the analysis and exploitability of data obtained from microbiological challenge tests.

**Maximum participants**: The face-to-face workshop accommodates a maximum of 40 trainees in order to maintain interactive work and discussion.
